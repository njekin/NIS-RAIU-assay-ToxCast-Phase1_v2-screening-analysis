# Introduction
This report includes all the R code in the analysis of ToxCast Phase 1_v2 chemical library screening results from the NIS radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) assay. With the aim of reproducible data analysis, this document was written in rmarkdown format and generated by R's `knitr` and `bookdown` package. 

A web book version of this document (easier to navigate), in addition with interactive dose-response plots is also available [at this link](https://njekin.github.io/NIS-RAIU-assay-ToxCast-Phase1_v2-screening-analysis/index.html).  


Key R functions written in this analysis were gathered as an R package `ToxPlot`. To install or view the most up-to-date source code please go to [github link](https://github.com/njekin/ToxPlot-R-Package). At the [end of this document](#source) the source code of these functions used in this analysis is also provided.
